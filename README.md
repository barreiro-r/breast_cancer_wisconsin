# Breast Cancer Wisconsin

This project applies the XGBoost machine learning algorithm in R to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## ðŸ“„ Dataset Overview
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains 699 patient records collected from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. Each sample is described by 9 numeric features capturing characteristics of the cell nuclei (e.g., clump thickness, cell size uniformity, mitoses).

- Observations: 699
- Features: 9 numeric attributes
- Target: Tumor class (benign = 0, malignant = 1)

We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from the `mlbench` package.
